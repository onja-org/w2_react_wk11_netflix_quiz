# Netflix Quiz Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Netflix Quiz Project! This is an educational coding challenge where you'll build an interactive movie quiz application using React and the REST API. You will practice essential web development skills including API integration, state management, component architecture, and creating engaging user interfaces.

### What You'll Build

An interactive quiz game that:
- Fetches real-time data from a REST API
- Provides immediate feedback on answers
- Tracks scores and allows retries
- Features a responsive, modern UI

		return this.options.title || this.options.name;
	}

# Work with the boilerplate code

## Run the code locally

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
